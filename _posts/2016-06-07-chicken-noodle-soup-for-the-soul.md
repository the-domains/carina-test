Chicken (noodle) soup for the soul

Listlessly drifting through a brief spell of apathy, I raided my kitchen to find something for dinner. My freezer was in need of emptying (there was no room for ice cream. Or ice for that matter, and how can one craft a cocktail without ice?), so I snagged a jar of chicken stock and a bag of cooked chicken pieces, both the result of a previous freezer-cleaning episode when I transformed my reserved chicken carcasses.

I figured I'd do an easy chicken soup, tossing in some of the yu choy I'd picked up at the Korean market earlier that day. But I really wanted noodles. Good, chewy, [Chinese noodles][0]. But there was no way I was going back out to the store - I was too lazy! So I decided to make up a batch as I waited for the meat and broth to defrost (another kitchen deficit is the lack of a microwave).

Kneading the dough put me into a bit of a trance as I focused on the feel of the dough under the heel of my hand, the way the side of my hand cupped the soft mass to pull it around before pressing my heel back into it, over and over again. And I felt the apathy drift away, replaced with peace. As I rolled out the dough, cut it, separated and lightly stretched the noodles, I enjoyed the way the flour-coated strands played in my fingers.

The broth was completely unseasoned - a perfectly neutral, intensely chicken-flavored canvas. A bit salt, soy sauce, Shiaoxing wine, chicken fat, and sesame oil seasoned the broth, and some fried shallots provided a savory sweet garnish to my chicken noodle soup.

I enjoyed every drop - and every minute of making it. I felt more at peace and optimistic than I had in over a week. They say chicken
